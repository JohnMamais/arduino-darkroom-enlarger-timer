# Arduino based Darkroom enlarger _(WIP)_

Here you can find the code, electronics schematics and any 3d printing related to this project.

This is based on a Nano type board but you can adapt it to use anything you have on hand.

## Bill of Materials
- 1 x 3-Pin Male Panel Mount AC Power Supply Socket
- 1 x 2-Contact switch (to turn everything on and off)
- 2 x fuse holder
- 1 x 0.6A fuse (for the arduino)
- 1 x fuse up to specs with your enlarger lamp (usually 1-1.5Amps)
- 1 x 240VAC/24VAC min 0.6A transformer
- 1 x bridge rectifier
- 1 x 2200uF/35V electrolytic capacitor
- 1 x LM7812
- 1 x LM7805
- 1 x 1N4007 diode
- 1 x BC547
- 1 x 10KΩ 1/8Watt resistor
- 1 x 12VDC 2(DC)+3(AC) contact relay (capable of 240 example https://grobotronics.com/12v-dpdt-8a-250v.html)
- 1 x BC547
- 6 x pushbuttons
- 1 x 5 position terminal block (display)
- 1 x 3 position terminal block (AC power)
- 2 x 2 position terminal blocks (enlarger and safelight outlets)
- 1 x Led Display 8-Digit with MAX7219 - **Red** (https://grobotronics.com/led-display-8-digit-with-max7219-red.html)
- 1 x Arduino (I used Nano clone but feel free to modify anything you need to use your prefered board)
- 2 x power outlets (for the enlarger and the safelight)
- 6 x 2 position terminal blocks (optional, for the buttons)
- 1 x Breadboard
